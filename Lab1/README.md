# Simple Robot Design and Control using MATLAB Robotics System Toolbox and SimScape Toolbox
This MATLAB project introduces the basics of designing and controlling a simple robot using 
MATLAB's Robotics System Toolbox and SimScape Toolbox. The project focuses on a straightforward
example, demonstrating control over the first two joints of a SCARA robot. The aim is to provide
a foundation upon which more complex robotic systems can be implemented and simulated.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
- simulate RobotArm.slx model

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following MATLAB toolboxes:

- Robotics System Toolbox
- SimScape Toolbox
- Ensure that you have these toolboxes installed and configured properly in your MATLAB environment before running the scripts.

## Usage
Modify the MATLAB scripts and functions as needed to implement and simulate more complex robotic systems.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for any improvements, bug fixes, or additional features.
